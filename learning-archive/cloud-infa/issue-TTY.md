# the input device is not a TTY, possible solutions

It seems like you are trying to execute a command in a running container using docker exec, but you are getting an error message saying “the input device is not a TTY”. This means that the input device (such as a terminal or a pipe) does not support the interactive and pseudo-TTY modes that you specified with the -it flags. There are a few possible solutions to this problem:

1. If you don’t need an interactive terminal or a TTY, you can simply remove the -it flags from your command. This will make it non-interactive and non-TTY, which is suitable for running commands in scripts or cron jobs. For example: docker exec ${CONTAINER_NAME} sh

2. If you need to pipe some input into the docker command, but you don’t need a TTY, you can use the -i flag without the -t flag. This will keep the STDIN open, but not allocate a TTY. For example: echo "hello" | docker exec -i ${CONTAINER_NAME} sh

3. If you need a TTY, but you don’t have one available on the input device, you can use the -t flag without the -i flag. This will allocate a pseudo-TTY, but not keep the STDIN open. This is useful for applications that check for a TTY to enable color formatting or cursor movement. For example: docker exec -t ${CONTAINER_NAME} sh

4. If you need an interactive terminal and a TTY, and you are running on a platform that supports them, you can use a different command line interface that provides them. For example, on Windows, you can use PowerShell instead of cmd.exe. For example: docker exec -it ${CONTAINER_NAME} sh
